# Detailed Description

## subject_id, hadm_id, stay_id

Identifiers which specify the patient: `subject_id` is unique to a patient, `hadm_id` is unique to a patient hospital stay and `stay_id` is unique to a patient ICU stay.

<!-- 
## `CGID`

`CGID` is the identifier for the caregiver who validated the given measurement.

## CHARTTIME

`CHARTTIME` is the time of an output event.

## STORETIME

`STORETIME` records the time at which an observation was manually input or manually validated by a member of the clinical staff.

## ITEMID

Identifier for a single measurement type in the database. Each row associated with one `ITEMID` (e.g. 212) corresponds to an instantiation of the same measurement (e.g. heart rate).

## VALUE, VALUEUOM

`VALUE` and `VALUEUOM` list the amount of a substance at the `CHARTTIME` (when the exact start time is unknown, but usually up to an hour before).
