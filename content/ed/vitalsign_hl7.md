# The VITALSIGN_HL7 table

**This table is not yet populated.**

Patients admitted to the emergency department may be monitored by telemetry.
Minute-by-minute vital signs for telemetry are communicated to a central server in the hospital, and these vital signs are recorded here.
However, vital signs are only communicated with patient identifiers manually input into the bedside monitors, a process which is not routine practice.
As a result, many patients who are monitored by telemetry do not have their vital signs recorded in this table.

**Table source:** Emergency department database.

**Table purpose:** Continuous vital signs for monitored patients.

**Number of rows:**

## `stay_id`

An identifier which uniquely identifies a single emergency department stay for a single patient.

## `charttime`

The date and time that the set of vital signs were recorded.

## `hr`

The patient's heart rate.

## `resp`

The patient's respiratory rate.

## `spo2`

The patient's peripheral oxygen saturation.

## `pulse`

The patient's heart rate derived from a photoplethysmogram.

## `nbp_d`, `nbp_m`, `nbp_s`

The patient's diastolic (d), mean (m), and systolic (s) blood pressure. The `n` indicates that the measurement was made non-invasively (i.e. with a blood pressure cuff).
