## Getting Access

Access to MIMIC-IV is strictly controlled by the LCP, and all users who wish to use MIMIC-IV must be granted approval to use the data directly by the LCP.
During the final preparation phase access is made available to members of the [Critical Data Consortium](https://clinicaldata.mit.edu/).

As data is distributed via Google Cloud Platform (GCP), a valid Google account is required to access the data. Accessing the data is done in three stages:

1. Users must become a credentialed user on PhysioNet with access to MIMIC-III. This process involves completing a training course in human subjects research and signing of a data use agreement. Details of this process [are available online](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access).
2. Users must add a valid Google account e-mail to their credentialed PhysioNet user account.
3. Users must contact mimic-support@physionet.org and request access to MIMIC-IV. The e-mail should state the name of the Consortium organization of which they are a member, and the PhysioNet account to which they would like access provisioned. The e-mail should be sent from an address associated with the Consortium organization, or have a member of the Consortium organization copied to verify your affiliation.

More detail on these three steps is provided below.d

### Credentialing

A user must be credentialed in order to access the database, as appropriate training is necessary for the handling of human subjects in research.
Credentialing requires completion of a training course, as follows:

- Register on the CITI program website, selecting “Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates” as your organization affiliation: https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0
- Follow the links to add a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates course. In the Human Subjects training category, select the “Data or Specimens Only Research” course
- Complete the course and save a copy of your certificate.

Once completed, register an account on PhysioNet. Navigate to the credentialing page, and apply for credentialed privileges: https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/

### Data use agreement

Once your account is credentialed, sign the data use agreement for MIMIC-III: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/

Be sure to specify the Google Cloud Platform account you will use: https://physionet.org/settings/cloud/

### Contact us

Once approved, send an e-mail to mimic-support@physionet.org with:

- The Critical Data Consortium organization you are a member of
- Your PhysioNet account
- Your request for MIMIC-IV and acknowledgement that you will abide by the same data use agreement as MIMIC-III and the terms in the Consortium agreement
